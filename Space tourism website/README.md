## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Javascript / React.js
- SASS / SCSS
- Flexbox, Mixins
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

One of the major things I learned with this challenge was to use Mixins in SCSS which helped me a lot. They allowed me to not keep repeating myself and write code that is much cleaner, and lot easier to read.

I also used react-router-dom to switch between the different components, and to me that was a new experience and I have found it to very effective rather than it's alternatives, and while on that process I found out that 'Switch' is no longer supported and has been replaced by 'Routes'.
